# BloodMetrixx
Axxess Hackathon 2023 Submission

## Inspiration:
Our team was inspired to create the BloodMetrixx chatbot after noticing a gap in the market for accessible and personalized health advice. We wanted to create a tool that could read blood test PDFs and provide users with actionable insights that were tailored to their specific needs.

## What we learned:
Throughout the development process, we learned a great deal about the complexities of blood level analysis and the nuances of providing personalized health advice. We also gained insights into how users interact with chatbots, and what features are most important for ensuring a positive user experience.

## How we built the project:
To build the BloodMetrixx application, we leveraged the power of AI and machine learning models. We used Llama, which is Meta's LLM, in order to parse and go through the blood test PDF and determine which of the user's tests required their attention. After this, we visualized the data for the user and utilized OpenAI's API in order to generate suggestions on how the user can improve his/her test results.

## Challenges we faced:
One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring the accuracy of the chatbot's recommendations. Blood level analysis can be complex, and we had to ensure that the recommendations provided are accurate and safe for patients. We also had to overcome technical challenges related to data processing and natural language processing, which required a great deal of testing and optimization.

Despite these challenges, we're incredibly proud of the final product, and we believe that BloodMetrixx has the potential to revolutionize the way that people access and interact with health advice.
